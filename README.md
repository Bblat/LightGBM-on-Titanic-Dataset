# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The model uses the following features: `Pclass` (passenger class), `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp` (number of siblings/spouses aboard), and `Parch` (number of parents/children aboard). The LightGBM algorithm, along with scikit-learn, is used to train and evaluate the model.

# Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
A confusion matrix and classification report have been generated to evaluate the performance of the model. The confusion matrix helps visualize the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. The classification report provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class (not survived and survived).
